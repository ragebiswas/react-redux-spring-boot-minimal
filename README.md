# react-redux-spring-boot-minimal
A minimal project using Spring-Boot on the server and React-Redux on the client with devtools

This project is *heavily* inspired by the excellent 
[Simple Redux Boilerplate](https://github.com/tsaiDavid/simple-redux-boilerplate) project.

## Motivation

The main motivation for creating this setup was to have the following:

 * A standard Maven-Spring-Boot configuration for the server side
 * Standard React-Redux on the client side, with hot-reloading goodness
 * Learning both of the above :-)
